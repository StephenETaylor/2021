This directory includes my two latest passes at automating the Tisk
directory on http://computersystemsartists.net/Tisk

The intention for this webpage is that I will load up the directory with
potential printing projects and then print them from the webpage,
that is, from the list of files displayed by index.html.

There are at this moment two versions of files for this purpose.
	index.htm  	contains javascript to display a list of files
			as candidates; clicking on the file
			brings the item up, so that it can then be printed.
			The list of files is typically generated in vim
			by inserting 
			ls
			then typing !!sh

			The main problem is that a new copy of index.htm
			must be edited and uploaded for each file added to print

	files.php 	is the ancestor of a "index.php" which will
			dynamically build the list of files based on the
			directory on the server.
			It will still be necessary to use filezilla to 
			load the directory, but not to edit index.htm each time.
