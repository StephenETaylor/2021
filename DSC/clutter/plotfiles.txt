5k-Results-fasttext-skipgram-cosine-cca-java
Only binary threshold, no nearest neighbors.

Reverse only for 50, 75, 250
Forward only for 25, 50, 75, 100, 150; still trending upward at 150, for the ranking task, not so much for binary.

Since Binary Threshold and Nearest Neighbor strategies apply only to binary 
task, not to ranking task, it isn't very surprising that the Bi-Fo and Ne-Fo
runs have similar results for the ranking task; likewise for Bi-Re and Ne-Re.

For the binary task, nearest neighbors is better for fasttext-cbow-arcos
