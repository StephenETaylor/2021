initial source file is subs1.py  (Older series was subspc*)
previous work on this project appeared in directories:
/home/staylor/spring19/batchNN/subspB.py
/home/staylor/fall18/subspaces/graphics/subspB.py
/home/staylor/fall19/Oct21Poster/graphics/subspB.py
/home/staylor/spring19/CICLing/graphics/subspB.py

currently working on subsp1.py in:

I downloaded the English.w2v.bin embedding from vectors.NLPL.eu.
It was in file 12.zip; the url is:
