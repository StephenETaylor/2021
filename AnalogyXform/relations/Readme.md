This family of analogy relations is based on Google Analogy Test Set:
    https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q32127146

In addition to breaking the quadruplets up into pairs,  I also modified
some of the relations because the English embedding I was using did not
include some words.  E.G. 'he', 'she', 'his', 'hers' are dropped from the
family relation.  They still appear in family~
