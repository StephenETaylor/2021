The experiments in this directory are a followup to those described in the
the paper:

    Stephen Taylor and Tomáš Brychcin, "Is there a linear subspace in which
    the difference vectors of word analogy pairs are parallel?" CICLing
    International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent
    Text Processing, La Rochelle, France, April 2019

The English text embedding is downloaded from Andrey Kutuzov's 
NLPL word embeddings repository at vectors.nlpl.eu/repository

The url is:
    http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/12.zip
The description is:
    Gigaword gensim continuous Skipgram lemmatization=False

The Arabic text embedding is from the same site.

The url is:
    http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/20/31.zip
The description is:
    Arabic CoNLL17 corpus gensim continuous Skipgram lemmatization=False
